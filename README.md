# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The provided `bug.java` file contains code that throws this exception.  The solution, `bugSolution.java`, corrects the error.

The error occurs because of an off-by-one error in a loop that iterates over an array. The loop condition is incorrect, causing an attempt to access an index that is out of bounds for the array.

This example showcases the importance of carefully examining loop conditions and array bounds when working with arrays in Java.
